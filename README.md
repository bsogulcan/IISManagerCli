# IISManagerCli
This project is a CLI application, developed to make the [IISManager](https://github.com/bsogulcan/IISManager) application easier to use.


## Installation 

For now, you can install only by downloading the release file. I am working on npm package.
After downloading the release file, it is necessary to specify the server profiles to which the CLI application connects.

```bash 
  "MyPc": {
    "IpAddress": "http://192.168.1.26",
    "Port": 3300
  },
  "Server-1": {
    "IpAddress": "http://10.34.76.4",
    "Port": 3200
  },
  "Server-2": {
    "IpAddress": "http://10.92.216.70",
    "Port": 3200
  }
```
